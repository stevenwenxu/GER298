Let me start this blog by telling a joke from the internet:

![german joke]({{site.baseurl}}/images-hq/communication/german_joke.jpg)

Yes, German is a much harder language than English, and yes, most young Germans speak really good English. So what's the point of learning German as a foreign language? And what's the point of trying to speak half-broken German with them, when you know English is a more effective alternative?

I'd like to answer this by quoting what Nelson Mandela said:

<blockquote><p>
If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart.
</p></blockquote>

In Germany, I always start a conversation with people in German. In a city like Berlin where tourism is an important industry, I still firmly believe that people will appreciate my effort in learning their language. Speaking from stories around me, pretty much all of my Canadian-born Chinese friends hate it when strangers start speaking Chinese to them, since they are judged by their appearence and "he/she must be Chinese" can a pretty good guess.
