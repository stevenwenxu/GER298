Before diving into food, I want to first share some really interesting German idioms on sausages. Literally "food for thought", right?

> Das ist mir alles Wurst! (This is all sausages to me!) \\
> meaning: "This is all the same to me" or "I don't care".

> Es geht um die Wurst! (It's all about the sausage!) \\
> meaning: "This is the time, now or nothing!"

I learned these a while ago from one of my favourate Youtubers [rewboss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pxp7eJIL3RI&ab_channel=rewboss) who is an Englishman who moved to Germany. In fact, along with some other channels, Youtube might be my most significant source of information on everything interesting related to German and Germany.

Now, it's literally all about the sausages!
