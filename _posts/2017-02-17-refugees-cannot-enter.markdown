While I was walking on the famous street "Unter den Linden", I saw a paper notice on a door of a shop that gave me some serious shocks. It literally meant to me "Refugees do not enter". I walked up close and tried to see if that was real, and yep, without a dictioanry I was pretty sure.

I pointed it out to my friends who did not know any German, and they were shocked as well. So the four of us stopped in front of a gift shop with serious and confused faces, and occasionally pointed to the paper sign. Because of the early time, the shop wasn't open yet, but there were already pedestrians on the street. I could feel that they were looking and staring at us strangely, which I interpreted as "go away you tourist, it's none of your business".

The owner of the shop next door walked out and asked me: "Kann ich Ihnen vielleicht helfen?" (May I help you?). I was too afraid so I replied "Nein danke" (no thanks), put my camera back in my pocket, and quickly walked away. I did not take a picture and did not dare to stand there for one more second.

So this became a mystery.

On the last day in Berlin, I knew I had to figure this out before leaving the country. I got up really early so I had enough time for this little trip before catching the plane, but more importantly it was early enough that there was nobody on the street. This time, for some (üòÖ) reason an English translation was also put below the sign. Aha! I laughed out so loud.

Here is the paper sign:

![refugees cannot enter]()

After looking it up in the dictioanry, I found out that the german sign literally says "do not block the escape route and the escape door". How did I interpret that as "Refugees do not enter"!?

Right before the trip, my GER 212 course was discussing topics regarding refugees, and we were given many articles about them. One article was about language loss and discussed a bunch of german words that mean refugees and some of them are no longer used.

- der Fl√ºchtling
- die Fl√ºchtlingin
- der Fl√ºchtende
- die Fl√ºchtende
- der Gefl√ºchtete
- die Gefl√ºchtete

You don't need to know German to identify the "fl√ºcht" part in each word. So I assumed the "Fluchtwege" and "Fluchtt√ºren" also have something to do with refugees. I feel so dumb because I actually know "Wege" means route and "T√ºren" means doors, but the "flucht" part triggers so much memory about the reading that I ignored the rest.

As for the word "verstellen", that was just a half-guessing half-knowing word interpreted under panic. I know "stellen" has something to do with putting things at places, so combined with the prefix "ver" and "nicht" (not) I mistakenly thought of "not to be put here", so together something along the lines of "refugees shouldn't be here".

This is probably a laughable mistake only German learners can understand. If I explain this to Germans, they would probably be confused instead of entertained.

I guess I'll never know why an English translation was up 9 days later.
