Call me a weirdo, but I love old things. Coincidentally, Museum der Dinge has old things. The museum focuses on how the life quality has improved over the years, does comparisons between east and west Germany, and poses a question "How should we live?". But I wasn't super interested in that. As a computer nerd, this museum has all my favourite vintage old tech, some of which I have only heard of but too young to have seen. I just have to share them in a post, because I think it says a lot about me.

### Addiator
##### It looks so cool! What does it do? Does it add?

### Subtractor
##### Does it subtract?

### Old calculators
##### Old, but more intuitive to me. The top left one looks like it's from the future.

### Typewritter with mechanical keyboard
##### Mechanical keyboards used to be standards, but now a luxury. What's with the hype of going thinner?

### Floppy Disk
##### I've used one of those. Really miss the sound the drive makes.

### Bigger floppy disk
##### I was born at a time when I have only seen the A: drives, but no the B: drives. This is it.

### Apple Message Pad
##### Can't get more exciting than that!

### Apple PS/2 Mouse
##### The current apple magic mouse is so bad. We need innovation like this.

### DOS installation disk and photoshop 7.0
##### I really really want them.

##### This looks like something I'd use.

### Macintosh PowerBook Duo 230 (1992)
##### Just look at the design. It's perfect.

### Macintosh PowerBook G3 (1997)
##### This was the cool thing. [Checkout how many TV series featured it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerBook_G3#In_popular_culture)

##### Durable and reliable.

##### Can you tell I'm an Apple fan now?

### iPod mini (2004)
##### I still can't believe I was not aware of this product line.

### The First iPhone (2007)
##### This was legendary. No need to say more.
