A major thing in traveling is the hotel experience. I lived in many hotels in many places, from small towns in China to the center of New York. Our hotel is a 5 star hotel, so I was pretty sure what I should expect. When I checked in, everything was nice and clean, but then...

> Where's the toothbrush and the mini toothpaste? \\
> Where's the free bottles of water? \\
> Where's the little sewing kit that I never use? \\
> Where's the slippers?

Where's everything? I thought these are "standards" in 5 star hotels, and especially since Berlin is a big city, I found it really obscure. I mean, the 4 star hotel I lived in Hong Kong even gave us free fruits every day, and a temporary Nokia flip phone with a sim card ready to call local numbers for free! And at here with one more star I have to not only buy an outlet adapter, but also a toothbrush?

When I talked to the profs about this, they were surprised that I was expecting all of these. When I started to question the implications of this in a "first world" developed country, some people in the group did not know how to get electricity in the room. Yes it was shocking, but it did not take long before I realized that I might be too spoiled. I probably learned how doors and electricity work in hotels when I was 10, and that's apparently not normal in this crowd.

When I realized this, I did not choose to complain about the lack of everything to my roommates. I've always hated the stereotypes on Chinese international students from other people, where they believe pretty much every Chinese student is from a super rich family whose parents buy them luxury cars, clothes and houses without blinking an eye. And the fact that we pay twice the amount of tuition and we do not have government OSAP make it worse.

It's sad that I have to hide my real feelings on my first day with my roommates, but I don't want to accidentally further develop these ignorant stereotypes inside people's head.
